# Improving your passive skills
## _How can I make things easier for myself without doing anything?_

Here I meant to teach you how to make things more bearable and easygoing. Things are hard for you, and don't need to be so much. 

The things here are pretty obvious, but you probably don't realize how powerful they are. For non-ADHD, they are helpful, but for you, they are game-changers. You will receive way more benefits than ordinary people. These are close to being cheat codes on a videogame.

## Exercise

Doing exercise is busted. Abuse it. Try to put it in every part of your life. You have way more energy in your head and body than others. It's like constantly on overload, and you need to burn this excess energy. 

Is it hard? It is. But it gets easier every day! 

 Exercise 3 to 4 days a week. Use the bike if possible to commute. If you find it boring, do sport with people. 

## Meditation: 
If you thought exercise was busted, have you ever tried meditation? The main problem for you is to focus. What if I tell you that you can train it? 

Completely busted. That's what meditation is. Use headspace to start. Excellent app. 

## Sleep
 You need to sleep. It's essential for your body and mind, and you need AT LEAST 7 hours a day. 

## Food
You need to avoid as much as you can garbage food. That's all. You don't need to be super healthy, just no garbage food. 


# How to work? (WIP)

## Do's

### Focus time / Meeting time

Having meetings is unavoidable. But it can be worse. Let's imagine you have a day like this:

![Meetings Hell](https://i.postimg.cc/FsDy1cXW/Screenshot-2022-11-26-at-17-49-54.png)

Technically, half of your time was occupied in meetings, not all of it. But you and I know It's impossible to get anything substantial done on those pesky windows of time.

The solution is simple. Reserve for yourself Focus Time when people cannot schedule a meeting. For this, you should put reasonably big focus time (2 to 4 hours) in your calendar for your more productive hours. Always name them as something as "Deep work. Contact only if necessary."

![Image of Google Calendar with Focus Time on it ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg1jvynhmdQaEQ5FrlrfmqyjPuGjpPqg2WnPZl-Oy4DRpQL89HaJts-uhq88BOU2AsKzGIiYNMbgfccKKUlhif3tjYZPKhmOMiRkcFdc8_1t9F9692aZ9HTftsb0djfersWtP1DppX-6QomSlztwDLLBUZLVseHNuTSkmtiFgOaL84uWlT8-5FATbka=w640-h572)

If they contact you, tell them you are getting something very important done and if it can wait. You may believe your work is less important than the meeting. But trust me, the things you do are important.

Obviously, don't be an asshole. Emergency and important meetings are still typical. But defend yourself from the nonessential ones. 

If you work remotely, [adding to the calendar your working hours](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308669?hl=en) is essential. Also solves timezones problems.


## Slack (WIP)

- Focus time: When in deep work, in the slack status put something like "deepwork" and an emoji that shows it.
- Don't try to be omniprecience: You don't need to be there all the time. In your deepwork don't try to be there all the time. Check it every so often but don't be there. Asyncronous communitation is key. WIP. Write it from a perpective of asyncronous programming.
- Asking for help: There are no stupid questions, only stupids who don't make them. Asking for help is stressful. I recommend using the not hello template. https://www.nohello.com/


## Distractions (WIP)

### Micro Distractions: The biggest offender

ADHRs brains go in bit of a hurry. You suddenly have an idea and if you didn't write it then it's gone. After that you'll get ditracted and you would have lost your train of thought. 

An excellent way to improve this is to just use the IDLE better and write faster. This solution is simple and effective.

Writting:
- Know your keyboard and write fast. Learn mecanography. Free options are https://thetypingcat.com/ and https://www.typing.com/. 
- Learn VScode commands: 
- Learn VIM or something similar. Haven't tried it yet. 

### Your Workplace
- Minimalistic
- Redundant
- Everything you need at hand
- Sadly, you'll need to put money into this.

Having meetings is unavoildable.

# Problems with people in the workplace

Sadly, in the workplace, people will not usually remember the things you did right, but the times you failed. That is a very pessimistic thing to say, but true.

**Luckily 90% of the problems you'll probably have will result only from 3 things.**

## You are not very good at estimating tasks, and people get mad about it.

As a rule of thumb. If you think something will take you a set amount of time. Increase it.

- If the task is simple: increase it by 30%
- If the task is medium: increase it by 60%
- If the task is complex: don't take it. No chance. Divide it into medium or simple tasks.

Why the last one? For ADHDrs starting a task has an enormous overhead and produces context switching, and it really is like that. 

If you barely think you won't be able to finish a deadline, say it as soon as possible and give them an overstimate for a new deadline. People are always understanding and appreciative of this quick communication. And if they don't, you need to find a better workplace. 

## You don't say no

People will always tell you if you could also do this extra stuff when you're already full of things to do. This is especially bad when the new task is urgent or has yet to be estimated.

When in such a situation, play this reverse Uno card:

> I'm already full of things to do. __Something I could do is remove this set of tasks in this sprint.__ There's no other way I could guarantee that task to be done in this sprint.

This is very professional behavior. Failing to deliver is more painful than not taking on extra tasks in the first place. If they get mad. So be it. 

Just be aware. You'll think you can do it anyway (and you probably can). Don't trick yourself: __being consistently reliable is more critical than achieving miracles.__ 


## People think you're lazy (WIP).

You'll come across as intelligent and creative, and people can misplace ADHD's struggles for laziness and lack of care. 


# How to meetings (WIP)

- Keep them short. 15 min. 
- Ask for material to get before the meeting. Looks good and is professional. 
- taking notes
- Leave when you're not essential to the conversation 


## Misc (WIP)
- Go for a walk
- Talking notes in meetings
- Todo list


## Medications (WIP)

It will be a game changer.

## Social media (WIP)
Just don't

## Programming is an objective driven career. Abuse that. 

Programming is objective-driven and requires creative thought. This is heaven for ADHDrs if managed correctly. Primarily for one reason: you don't need to work long hours.

Long working hours suck for ADHDrs. If you get into hyper-focus, you'll end up exhausted. And being a weary programmer is extremely dangerous. Programming requires intense concentration, and mistakes are expensive. 

Luckily, ADHDrs are outstanding workers that sometimes can achieve more in less time. Sometimes you'll even be stuck for days with no results just to come up with an idea doing something unrelated. Why not challenge yourself to do that daily? 

If you can do your daily tasks instead of in 8 hours in 5. Then take the rest of the day off. The more well-rested you're, the more significant the chances you'll achieve something similar.

You're a programmer. Nobody, except some boomer bosses, cares if you work fewer hours. They care about you delivering quality programs before a deadline.

Obviously, if you finish a task super early (less than 4 hours), I would recommend you do the following:

- Check the company's documentation and try to improve. Everybody will love you.
- Study something related to your work. This will have a compound effect. The more you know, the earlier you'll finish your tasks, the more free time to study you'll have, the more...
- Increase test coverage.
- Plan a task in the backlog.
- Help somebody else
- Improve curent processes. 

You'll notice how people will love you because you go above and beyond for the company. But honestly, you're just working smartly.

Refrain from challenging yourself by taking more tasks per sprint but instead, try to finish them early. Take active care of your body and mind, and be sharp and continue. You can always do more if you really want anyway.
