## _How can I make things easier for myself without doing anything?_

Here I meant to teach you how to make things more bearable and easygoing. Things are hard for you, and don't need to be so much. 

The things here are pretty obvious, but you probably don't realize how powerful they are. For non-ADHD, they are helpful, but for you, they are game-changers. You will receive way more benefits than ordinary people. These are close to being cheat codes on a videogame.

## Exercise

Doing exercise is busted. Abuse it. Try to put it in every part of your life. You have way more energy in your head and body than others. It's like constantly on overload, and you need to burn this excess energy. 

Is it hard? It is. But it gets easier every day! 

 Exercise 3 to 4 days a week. Use the bike if possible to commute. If you find it boring, do sport with people. 

## Meditation: 
If you thought exercise was busted, have you ever tried meditation? The main problem for you is to focus. What if I tell you that you can train it? Completely busted. 

Completely busted. That's what meditation is. Use headspace to start. Excellent app. 

## Sleep
 You need to sleep. It's essential for your body and mind, and you need AT LEAST 7 hours a day. 

## Food
You need to avoid as much as you can garbage food. That's all. You don't need to be super healthy, just no garbage food.
