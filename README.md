# Improving your passive skills
## _How can I make things easier for myself without doing anything?_

Here I meant to teach you how to make things more bearable and easygoing. Things are hard for you, and don't need to be so much. 

The things here are pretty obvious, but you probably don't realize how powerful they are. For non-ADHD, they are helpful, but for you, they are game-changers. You will receive way more benefits than ordinary people. These are close to being cheat codes on a videogame.

## Exercise

Doing exercise is busted. Abuse it. Try to put it in every part of your life. You have way more energy in your head and body than others. It's like constantly on overload, and you need to burn this excess energy. 

Is it hard? It is. But it gets easier every day! 

 Exercise 3 to 4 days a week. Use the bike if possible to commute. If you find it boring, do sport with people. 

## Meditation: 
If you thought exercise was busted, have you ever tried meditation? The main problem for you is to focus. What if I tell you that you can train it? 

Completely busted. That's what meditation is. Use headspace to start. Excellent app. 

## Sleep
 You need to sleep. It's essential for your body and mind, and you need AT LEAST 7 hours a day. 

## Food
You need to avoid as much as you can garbage food. That's all. You don't need to be super healthy, just no garbage food. 

# Problems with people in the workplace

Sadly, in the workplace, people will not usually remember the things you did right, but the times you failed. That is a very pessimistic thing to say, but true. 

**Luckily 90% of the problems you'll probably have will result only from 3 things.**

## You are not very good at estimating tasks, and people get mad about it. 

As a rule of thumb. If you think something will take you a set amount of time. Increase it.

If the task is simple:  increase it by 50%
If the task is medium: increase it by 100%
If the task is complex: don't take it. No chance. Divide it into medium or simple tasks.

If the task is stupidly small: increase it by 300%. 

Why the last one? For ADHDrs starting a task has an enormous overhead and produces context switching, and it really is like that. 

If you barely think you won't be able to finish a deadline, say it as soon as possible and give them an overstimate for a new deadline. People are always understanding and appreciative of this quick communication. And if they don't, you need to find a better workplace. 

## You don't say no

People will always tell you if you could also do this extra stuff when you're already full of things to do. This is especially bad when the new task is urgent or has yet to be estimated. 

When in such a situation, play this reverse Uno card: 
I'm already full of things to do. Something I could do is remove this set of tasks in this sprint. There's no other way I could guarantee that task to be done in this sprint. 
This is very professional behavior. Failing to deliver is more painful than not taking on extra tasks in the first place. If they get mad. So be it. 

Just be aware. You'll think you can do it anyway (and you probably can). Don't trick yourself: being consistently reliable is more critical than achieving miracles. 


## People think you're lazy (WIP).

You'll come across as intelligent and creative, and people can misplace ADHD's struggles for laziness and lack of care.
